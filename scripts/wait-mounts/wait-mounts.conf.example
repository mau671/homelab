# ===============================================================================
# Example Configuration File for wait-mounts.sh
# ===============================================================================
# 
# This file contains configuration options for the LXC Container Mount
# Dependency Manager script. Copy this file and modify it according to
# your environment requirements.
#
# Usage: sudo bash wait-mounts.sh --config /path/to/your/config.conf
#
# ===============================================================================

# Mount points to monitor (supports two formats)
# These are the mount points that containers depend on
# Examples: NFS mounts, CIFS shares, USB drives, etc.

# Format 1: Bash array syntax (recommended for paths with spaces)
MOUNT_POINTS=("/mnt/server" "/mnt/onedrive" "/mnt/backup")

# Format 2: Comma-separated list (legacy format, still supported)
# MOUNT_POINTS="/mnt/server,/mnt/onedrive,/mnt/backup"

# LXC container IDs to manage (comma-separated list)
# These containers will be restarted when all mounts become available
CONTAINERS="101,102,104,105"

# Maximum time to wait for mounts (in seconds)
# After this timeout, the script will either exit (interactive) or restart the cycle (daemon)
TIMEOUT=300

# Interval between mount checks (in seconds)
# How often to check if mounts are available during the waiting phase
CHECK_INTERVAL=5

# Log file path
# Where to store detailed logs of the script's operations
LOG_PATH="/var/log/wait-mounts.log"

# ===============================================================================
# Additional Notes:
# ===============================================================================
#
# 1. All paths should be absolute (starting with /)
# 2. Container IDs must exist in your Proxmox VE environment
# 3. Mount point directories should exist even if not mounted
# 4. The script must be run with root privileges
# 5. For systemd service usage, use daemon mode: --daemon
#
# Example systemd service file:
# [Unit]
# Description=LXC Mount Dependency Manager
# After=network.target
# 
# [Service]
# Type=simple
# ExecStart=/path/to/wait-mounts.sh --config /etc/wait-mounts.conf --daemon
# Restart=always
# RestartSec=10
# 
# [Install]
# WantedBy=multi-user.target
